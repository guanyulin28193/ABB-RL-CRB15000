# ABB CRB1100 With Unity MLAgents
This is a scene with an CRB1100 set up with very basic MLAgents observations and actions. 

Needs to be extended to be useful. 

Currently, the physical parameters are wildly wrong.
Pivot positions are relatively good approximations.
Angular constraints are accurate, according to the ABB datasheet.

Build an executable and run from python. An example of the python side code can be found in example_unity_abb.py
